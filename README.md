# American-Express-Default-Prediction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of credit card default for customers of American Express. Using historical data, the analysis identifies key factors contributing to default risk and evaluates different predictive models to enhance decision-making.

Key Highlights:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights into the dataset to identify patterns and correlations.
Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features to improve predictive performance.
Modeling: Implementation and evaluation of machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC for model evaluation.
Outcome: The model provides insights into customer default behavior, aiding financial institutions in risk assessment.
This repository contains the notebook with code, data preprocessing techniques, model training, and evaluation results.
